# Fuerte is a strong password generator with no dependencies

"Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone
to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy
for computers to guess." â€” [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/936/)

![To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

Fuerte is a simple, strong password generator. 

It can create strong 
passwords that you should be using, because they're long and
easy to remember, like `correct horse battery staple`,
but it can also create the sorts of strong passwords that your bank
and your insurance company want you to use, because they're
complicated, like `Tr0ub4dor&3`.

In a pinch, it can even blend the two heuristics to create something 
like `correct!HORSE3battery%staple`, which, while difficult to
memorize, is at least equally difficult for a computer to guess.

The library is available for JavaScript and PHP projects, and if
you're using PHP, it installs easily into Laravel and WordPress
projects.
